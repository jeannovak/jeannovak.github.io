My name is Jean Novak and this is a repository for useful stuff I discovered, learned and developed through the years of messing around with network and, since last year, with pentest and purple team.

I have been really focused in Cisco R&S, Security and Datacenter, Palo Alto firewalls and Windows/Linux integrations which such products. However I have been diving deep in Web Security/Pentesting and forensics after achieving a Bronze medal in cybersecurity at WorldSkills 2019.
